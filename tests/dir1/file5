Traversing a directory, a common task in various programming applications, involves navigating through the files and subdirectories in a folder. In Java, there exist different strategies for directory traversal, with recursion and iteration employing a stack being two common approaches. Recursion necessitates a function repeatedly calling itself to solve a problem, whereas iteration utilizing a stack requires a data structure to track the program's state. Both methods possess their own advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal approach hinges on the particular needs of the program. This article delves into both methods, presenting sample code to exemplify their use in Java.
